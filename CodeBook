Unzip the data to your local computer, it will create a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset". Set it as working directory in R 

The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

1. Read in eight files: 

train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt -- contain 561 variables that represent 561 features; there are 7352 observations for 
                                          train setvand 2947 for test set.
                                          
train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt -- contain activity IDs for each observations in train and test datasets.

train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt -- contain subject IDs; there are 21 subjects in train set and 9 subjects
                                          in test set.
                                          
features.txt -- contains 561 features, of which 33 are the measurements on the mean and 33 on the standard deviation.

activity_labels.txt -- contains 6 activity IDs and names (1-WALKING, 2-WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3-WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
                                                          4-SITTING, 5-STANDING, 6-LAYING)


2. Combine three datasets (x, y, subject) together for both train and test, merge them with features and activity_labels
to get descriptive names for all the variables in the combined datasets

3. Merge two combined datasets (train and test) to create one dataset

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the merged dataset

5. Melt the extracted merged dataset by subject and activity and cast it back to the tidy_data format with function of mean;
the output dataset is an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

6. Export the independent tidy dataset to a text file.
