Unzip the data to your local computer, it will create a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset". Set it as working directory in R 

The attached R script (run_analysis.R) performs the following to clean up the data:

1. Read in eight files: 

train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt -- contain 561 variables that represent 561 features; there are 7352 observations for 
                                          train setvand 2947 for test set.
                                          
train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt -- contain activity IDs for each observations in train and test datasets.

train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt -- contain subject IDs; there are 21 subjects in train set and 9 subjects
                                          in test set.
                                          
features.txt -- contains 561 features, of which 33 are the measurements on the mean and 33 on the standard deviation.

activity_labels.txt -- contains 6 activity IDs and names (1-WALKING, 2-WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3-WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
                                                          4-SITTING, 5-STANDING, 6-LAYING)


2. Combine three datasets (x, y, subject) together for both train and test, merge them with features and activity_labels
to get descriptive names for all the variables in the combined datasets. The results are 7352 X 564 data frame for train
set and 2947 X 564 data frame for test.

3. Merge two combined datasets (train and test) to create one dataset with 10299 observations and 564 variables.

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the merged dataset. The 
result is a 10299 X 69 data frame, the 1st column contain subject IDs that range from 1 to 30, the 2nd column contain 
activity IDs that range from 1 to 6, the 3rd column contains activity names (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING), and the rest 66 columns are the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement. 

5. Melt the extracted merged dataset by subject and activity and cast it back to the tidy_data format with function of 
mean; the output dataset is an independent tidy data set of 40 X 69 data frame with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.

6. Export the independent tidy dataset to a text file named tidyds.txt.
